#### How to Become a Knight's Marshal for Your Local Group for the Office of the Marshallate in the Kingdom of Atlantia

The question is: *How do I make it easy and simple for them to make me the new Knight's Marshal for my group and do it quickly?*

First off, you have to be qualified. You have to be a current member and you have to be warranted in a discipline. You should to able to send a receive e-mail and access the internet. Then you can be an *applicant*.

For a Shire Knight's Marshal. The applicant sends an e-mail with his information on it and the words actually requesting the office to the outgoing marshal who approves and sends this to the Shire Seneschal. The seneschal sends this to the Kingdom Deputy responsible for the discipline the applicant is warranted in. If the applicant is a rapier fighter, for example, the Deputy Kingdom Rapier Marshal has to know one of his marshals is stepping up. If all is in order, the application can be approved. The Kingdom Deputy is the approving authority and will notify the Roster deputy while CC'ing the Earl Marshal.

For a Canton Knight's Marshal. The applicant sends an e-mail with all of his information on it and the words actually requesting the office. The outgoing Marshal approves and sends this to the Canton Seneschal. The seneschal sends this to the Baronial Knight's Marshal.  The marshal forwards the request to the Kingdom Deputy responsible for the discipline the applicant is warranted in. The Kingdom Deputy is the approving authority and will notify the Roster deputy while CC'ing the Earl Marshal.

For a Baronial Knight's Marshal. The applicant sends and e-mail with all of his information on it and the words actually requesting the office. The outgoing marshal approves and sends this to the Baronial Seneschal and the Coronets. They send this request to two people: The Kingdom Deputy responsible for the discipline the Applicant is warranted in and the Kingdom Earl Marshal.  The Kingdom Earl Marshal is the approving authority and will notify the Roster deputy.

#### The key for success

The ideal, perfect situation is when the Kingdom Deputy or the Kingdom Earl Marshal receives one AND ONLY ONE e-mail that has everyone concurring on it. That dramatically simplifies the process.

In the cases where there is no outgoing marshal to attest to the worthiness of the applicant, the local officers' input is welcome and appreciated. In a Barony, the Baronial Knight's Marshal is expected to be leading, training, and grooming the local marshals and MIT's to keep a cadre of qualified people ready to assume these offices as necessary. I know that is not always possible, but that is the ideal. It is important to show the utmost courtesy and respect to the landed Baron's and Baronesses by including them in the decision making process in matters pertaining to officers in their barony.
