# Introduction

**THIS IS A DRAFT PROCESS**

This document discusses a proposed implementation guide for inclusion of a
Society level approved weapons form into an existing combat system of
Atlantia's marshallate.

Introducing a new weapons form in the kingdom should be done in a controlled
fashion to ensure an widely communicated exposure, explaining the intent,
initial interpretation, and uniformity of implementation.  Once the kingdom at
large has an initial exposure, organic growth, experimentation, and change of
the weapon form should be supported and encouraged.

This process should model an SCA marshal experimentation process, though with a
significantly reduced risk profile and documentation requirement.

# Drafting Rules

A update to the kingdom policy outlining the changes required to include the
new format.  This draft should be reviewed by senior marshals to ensure it does
not conflict with society rules.

Important guidelines when drafting rules:
1. Ensure any item in the society rules identified as "as defined by the kingdom" is appropriately addressed in the update.
1. Make attempt to limit additional policy restrictions to safety focused additions, allowing the participating community to define what "game play" choices make sense for their venue.
1. Read & interact with neighboring kingdoms & principals at major near by wars (Pennsic & Gulf Wars) to understand and reduce potential conflict in interpretation when our kingdom travels elsewhere.

# Getting Rules Approved

The rules must be reviewed and approved first by the Kingdom Earl Marshal, then
their Royal Majesties.  

If the changes impact Kingdom Law, the changes must be first announced through
the Curia process.  If the changes only impact Kingdom Policy, Curia is not
needed.

Please see the Kingdom Seneschal's [Clerk of
Law](http://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law) for information on
the procedures for updating kingdom policy or law.

# Communicate with other Principals

At a minimum, all authorizations must have appropriate paperwork within the office of the Minister of the List.  Interact with the Kingdom MOL **BEFORE** the rules go into effect such that they can appropriately prepare for the change.

Ensure any other office in the kingdom that is impacted also has sufficently advanced notice to the potential change.

# Announce intent to include new combat authorization

Preferably at Unevent or Curia, hold a public forum describing the upcoming new weapons form.  At this time, advertise the request to participate, gathering all interested names for later review.

# Review initial interested participants

Kingdom policy stipulates that two marshals are required to run an authorization and both marshals must be authorized in the form being attempted.  As such, it is critical to ensure that the initial set of participants is of sufficent size to allow growth throughout the entire kingdom.

Review criteria:
1. Hold an appropriate active marshal warrant
1. Demonstrable control with the weapons form
1. Show good temperment and judgement
1. Willingness to let participants pass or fail authorizations on the demonstrated requirements alone
1. Not the cause of recent or on-going marshal incidents

Actively recruitment may be needed in far reaches of the kingdom.  Past kingdom marshal deputies of combat system, marshal peers of the form, or current "marshal instructors" are good candidates to interact with directly if they have not made their interest known.  This may require significant travel from the kingdom marshal staff to interact with and evaluate interest for weapons forms not previously experienced.

Review and select from all those that have indicated interest in being initial participants with senior marshals in the combat system.  As an example, for rapier, the KRM and deputy KRMs should perform this process.

The selected participants should be told of their inclusion, then the list should be communicated to the KMOL for inclusion in the authorizations roster.  Once included in the KMOL's database, the initial set and all new authorizations by marshals of the form should be widely disseminated to enable all those with interest the opportunity to seek them out for training and authorization.

# Hold Public Information Sessions

Hold public demonstration and training sessions for the weapon forms.  

In addition to supporting as many local events as possible, ensure that the major kingdom events are supported with an pre-announced and schedued sessions.  At a minimum, include these events:
* University
* Major Events with combat (Ymir, Gem Joust, or War of the Wings)
* Inter-kingdom wars (Pennsic and Gulfwars)

If possible, record and desiminate demonstration videos, highlighting "good" actions and explaining how to recognize "known bad" actions.

# Interact with Event MICs for inclusion

Monitor the kingdom calendar, mailing lists, and online communications channels (Facebook, etc) for candidate events to include the new weapons forms.  Interact with Event marshals to get their support in inclusion of the weapons forms.  Traveling to remote events to enable the participation may be required.  Make special effort to communicate with all those marshals with the new authorizations are aware of these events and are available to spread the knowledge and participation as best able.

# Review all marshals reports

During the first year of a roll out, special attention should be taken in both writing and reviewing marshal reports of the weapons forms.  The reporting form should be updated to indicate specific requests for information.  Any indicent should be reviewed with all reasonable speed to address issues early in the rollout process.
