# Introduction and Course Goals

The goal of the Rapier 101 class is to provide individuals with the basic background required to begin a successful journey toward a marshal's warrant.  While we do touch on many rules, it is not an instruction in all rules of rapier combat.  This outline, in fact, assumes that the instructor and students are thoroughly familiar with the most recent edition of the Society Marshal's Handbook and Kingdom Policy as it relates to rapier combat. Prospective MITs are required to complete both Rapier 101 and Field 201 before taking the field as MITs.

Please send comments to the [Deputy Earl Marshal for Training](mailto:dem-training@atlantia.sca.org) and the [Deputy Earl Marshal for Rapier](mailto:dem-rapier@atlantia.sca.org).

# Marshal in Training (MIT) Program

## Purpose
* Attempt to ensure a uniformity of training and experience among the marshallate such that rules are being enforced in the same way across the Kingdom.
* Provide new marshals with the mental toolkit necessary to manage fights and uphold armor and weapons standards in potentially stressful situations
* **REMEMBER**: MITs are **NOT** marshals and cannot, on their own, monitor fights, inspect weapons, sign off on paperwork, or perform any other marshal duties

## Requirements
* This class
* Field Marshal 201
* A sponsoring marshal
    * Provide guidance and practical instruction to the MIT
    * Certify the competence of the MIT
* 3+ events, two outside your local group, one outside your region, one with melee activity
* [MIT Form](/documents/forms/mit.docx)
* A copy of the [rules](/rapier/)
* When finished, request a rapier marshal warrant with the completed MIT form via the [Kingdom Warrant Website](https://warrant.atlantia.sca.org)
* Renewal of the class is required every three years (the Unevent meeting counts)

# Armor Standards and Inspections

## Materials
* Abrasion-resistant material: material that withstands normal combat stresses (such as being snagged by an unbroken blade) without tearing.
    * Nylon pantyhose and cotton gauze shirts are examples of unacceptable materials.
* Puncture-resistant material: any fabric or combination of fabrics that will predictably withstand puncture.
    * MUST be tested every two years and must be tested the first time new gear is used or if no marshal on the field knows a given piece of gear to have been tested. They may also be tested at the marshal's discretion.
        * Fabric testing for protective gear should be done as described in the Society Fencing Marshal's Handbook in Appendix 1.
        * UnderArmour, Spandex and other similar stretchy materials are not suitable as puncture-resistant materials. In addition, Kevlar is not an acceptable material as it degrades rapidly.
* Rigid Material: puncture-resistant material that will not significantly flex, spread apart, or deform under pressure of 12 kg applied by a standard mask tester, repeatedly to any single point.
* Marshals should acquire and bring appropriate armor and mask testing equipment to practices and events they run.

## How to Inspect
* Inspections are pass/fail first. Ensure that the fighter knows that they have passed or failed, and provide the reason for any failure.  A fighter should be given the opportunity to remedy the failure and return to the marshal who failed the item for re-inspection.
* If you wish to provide an opinion on an item, such as one that may be legal, but close to failure, be clear in your language so that the fighter understands that the information that you are offering is your opinion, not a requirement.
* Conduct the inspection in the same order every time as this will help you avoid making errors
    * Have you signed in with the MOL?
    * Are you wearing personal protection as required?
    * Has your armor passed a punch test in the last 2 years?
    * Armor first, head to toes, then weapons
* Inspections must occur at each event, practice, and every day for multi-day events

## Head
* Check masks and helms for fit, wear, and padding. Mask and helms should be inspected both on **AND** off the combatant. "It is the mask I always wear" is **NOT** sufficient
* Must be secured as to not be dislodged or removed during combat
    * Specifically, a snug-fit mask and spring-tongue is not sufficient to meet this requirement.
    * Check for elastic bands that are no longer elastic
* Place your hand flat on the faceplate and ask the fighter to lean forward into your hand.  The mask/helm should not shift or contact their face
* Helmet faceplates must not have holes larger than 1/8" in diameter, with a minimum offset of 3/16"
* Check mask mesh for significant dents, especially if they flex.  If there is concern about the face mesh of a modern fencing mask, it should be tested using a standard commercial 12kg mask punch.  Marshals doing the testing shall be trained in the use of the punch.
* For CUT & THRUST – verify the back of the head is covered by rigid material lined by at least 1/4" (6mm) of closed cell foam or an equivalent padding.

## Neck
* For everything but light rapier, verify the fighter is wearing a rigid gorget covering the entire throat, backed by either puncture resistant material or the equivalent of 1/4" (6 mm) of open cell foam.
* Ensure the cervical vertebrae are protected by some combination of gorget, helm, and/or hood insert.

## Torso
* The entire torso (the chest, back, abdomen, groin, and sides up to and including the armpits) must be covered with at least puncture-resistant material.
  * Verify the armpits have puncture-resistant coverage, as this is where people most often forget
* Chain mail shirts are legal provided they pass the punch test.  Verify there are no missing rings in vital areas.  If you can't see it because the fighter is wearing a shirt over, politely ask them to return to you so you can check it without any covering.  Again, especially check the underarms
* Verify torso coverage won't shift significantly to provide a gap in armor

## Legs & Arms
* All other areas not discussed previously must be covered in abrasion-resistant material.  No bare skin
* For cut and thrust, verify at least soft elbows are being worn
* Also for cut and thrust, verify hands have padded gloves or full rigid if one combatant is using a two-handed weapon.

# Weapon Standards and Inspections
## Blades
* Any blade with kinks, sharp bends, or cracks fails
* All burrs on a blade must be removed prior to use
* Verify tips:
    * Will not be dislodged easily
    * Contrasting color tape is used
    * **NO** tape covers the end of the tip
    * Has adequate protection against punch-through (i.e., metal in the tip)
* If flex of a blade is questioned, be prepared to test it to Society standards
* Light rapier blades & flexidaggers must not have "S" curves
* Light rapier blades are not allowed in Rapier nor Cut & Thrust combat.
* Flexi-daggers are not allowed for Cut & Thrust combat.
* Rigid steel "parrying-only" daggers such as those made from cut down blades will not be allowed.

## Spear
* Rubber headed spears, mounted on rattan between 1 1/8th and 1 3/8th inch diameter
* Head must flex to 90 degrees with hand pressure, and return to normal
* Combined length of 4 to 9 feet
* Minimum diameter inserted into the head end is 1/2 inch
* Heads must be friction fit with tape including bright contrasting colored tape or ribbon at the base of the the spear head for visual contrast.

## Rigid Parry
* Rigid parrying devices will be made of sturdy, lightweight materials, resistant to breakage & splintering and does not have any sharp edges.

## Soft parry
* Soft parry devices shall not be weighted with any rigid material nor with materials which are heavy enough to turn the device into a flail or impact weapon.

## Overall appearance 10' rule
* Intention is to improve the appearance of the field, not prevent people from playing
* Fighter's kit shall look medieval at a distance of 10' or greater
* In general, this means no obvious sports logos, fluorescent colors, etc.
* Sports armor should be completely covered, with the exception of fencing masks.
* Be especially polite and helpful in enforcement of this rule, but firm. This also applies to authorizing fighters. This is something that should be first addressed at the local practice level.
* If an authorizing fighter does not meet this standard find out who is running their practice and talk to that marshal.

# Authorizations

The process to authorize in rapier is defined on the [marshal's website](/procedures/rapier-authorization/).  Rather than iterate over the procedure in detail, the following are important items to take into account when running an authorization.

## Authorization Forms

* Light Rapier
* Rapier (previously known as Heavy Rapier)
* Rapier with a two-handed sword (not longsword)
* Cut & Thrust
* Cut & Thrust with a two handed sword (still not longsword)
* Rapier Spear (Allows user to participate in combat using spears against rapier, C&T, or spear opponents)

Using Projectile Weapons within rapier combat is now governed by Combat Archery marshals, including Rubber Band Guns, Bows, Crossbows, and thrown weapons.  To use Projectile Weapons in Rapier Combat, the combat must be marshaled by a rapier marshal AND a combat archery marshal.

## Selecting an usher
   * Try to select a fighter with at least three years of experience
   * They should be unflappable in personality and controlled in their fighting
   * Confirm with the usher that they must be willing to be struck by the authorizing fighter, to deliberately leave openings
   * The usher should not regularly practice with the candidate.

## Selecting marshals
   * Authorizing marshals should be experienced individuals who know rapier combat well
   * They must be willing to let the authorizing fighter stand on their own merits and be willing to fail an individual
   * At least one marshal must be from a group outside of the authorizing fighter's local group
   * The marshals should not regularly practice with the candidate

## Questions
   * Authorizing fighter must have read the rules of the list and must demonstrate a command of them.
   * Marshals will not answer questions for fighters, nor provide hints
   * Authorizing fighter should be encouraged to demonstrate a point (of say, how to obtain engagement) if they cannot express the requirements clearly verbally
   * Authorizing fighter will not proceed to the fighting phases unless the fighter has demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the rules of the list.

## Criteria for passing for light rapier and rapier
   * Comprehension and application of the SCA Rules of the List, SCA Fencing Marshal's Handbook, and the "General Policies" and "Rapier Combat" sections of the "Policies of the Kingdom Earl Marshal" in the Atlantian Book of Policy.
      * The fighter must know the intent and spirit of the law. They do not need to know the letter of the law.
   * Ability to properly execute and acknowledge various valid blows.
   * Safe and competent execution of offense and defense during actual combat. Fighter should be able to adjust defense to protect different parts of the body as blows are thrown to those areas.
   * Authorizing fighter must behave and fight in such a fashion as to not be a danger to themselves or others
      * Examples of unacceptable behavior would include:
         * failing to stop on the call of Hold
         * cringing or dropping of defense when not in hold
         * striking the usher repeatedly with something other than the striking surface of the weapon
         * striking the usher repeatedly with excessive blows
   * The level of skill required and described above should be considered:  "competence"

## Criteria for passing for Cut & Thrust or Spear combat authorization
   * "Competence" as described above
   * A higher standard applies as the addition of percussive cuts requires a greater degree of skill to ensure safety for the fighter and opponents
   * Authorizing fighter must demonstrate the ability to conduct attacks in series, incorporating multiple blows and/or feints
   * Authorizing fighter must demonstrate a defense capable of protecting against complex attacks such as described above
   * Must show control over the weapon and the power generated when throwing form specific blows.
   * For spear, must show control when abruptly charged by their opponent.

## Paperwork
   * It is the responsibility of the authorizing fighter to obtain all appropriate signatures on paperwork upon conclusion of the authorization


# Injuries on the field
* Marshals (generally speaking) are not physicians, but do have a responsibility to the safety of fighters under their management.  Fighters should be allowed to monitor their own level of injury and gauge their ability to engage in combat activities.  Some special cases, however, are mentioned below:

## Bloodborne pathogens
   * Fighters with freely flowing wounds must be removed from the field until the wounds can be dressed in such a way to prevent blood (or vomit) from coming into contact with other participants.
   * Marshals should seek to identify the root cause of any cut or bloody injury to confirm that the armor and weapons of the participants continue to meet Society standards.

## Concussions
   * Fighters who are rendered unconscious may not return to the field that day and should be encouraged to seek professional medical care.
   * Some signs and symptoms of a concussion are:
      * Blank stare, dazed look
      * Changes to balance, coordination, reaction time
      * Delayed or slowed spoken or physical responses
      * Disorientation (confused about time, date, location, game)
      * Loss of consciousness/blackout (occurs in less than 10% of cases)
      * Memory loss of event before, during, or after injury occurred
      * Slurred/unclear speech
      * Vomiting

## Excessive Impact
* Combat in the Society poses risks to the participant. This recognition, however, does not excuse fighters from exercising control of their techniques. If a fighter throws blows which force their opponent to retire from the field, from a real injury (even one which only causes brief incapacitation), the marshal responsible for the field shall take such steps as are appropriate to stop the problem from recurring.
    * If this occurs it will be included in the event report.


# Marshalling a fight
## How to watch a fight
* As the fighters are entering the list, visually inspect them to confirm that there is no obviously missing or defective armor.
* A marshal should stand in a location relative to the fight that provides the maximum ability to view the fight.  This means as the fight moves, you may need to move as well
* A marshal should be able to identify hit location and whether a blow was delivered edge-on or flat.  A marshal may NOT call whether a blow is good or not.

## Spectator Management
* Marshals must keep spectators and unarmored fighters outside of the safety zones around the outside of the list.

## Showmanship and field presence
* Marshals will conduct themselves in a calm and chivalrous manner at all times.
* Marshals will hold themselves to the same level of conduct or higher that we expect from our fighters. Any behavior unacceptable in a fighter is unacceptable in a marshal.
* Marshals cannot both marshal and fight in the same activity. If an event has multiple rapier activities occurring at a given event, they marshal one activity and fight in a separate activity.
* At the end of each bout, the Marshals will ask each fighter if they are satisfied with the conduct of the bout.
* Marshals should be identifiable to spectators and fighters as a marshal from a distance by wearing the badge of the office and having a marshal's staff.

## Melees
* In melees, fighters are engaged with all opponents immediately upon the call to lay on.
* Make sure you have enough marshals for the size melee you are running.  There are guidelines in the Society rules
* Combatants may strike any single opponent they can safely reach with any legal blow if they are within a 180 degree arc of the opponent’s front as defined by the opponent’s shoulders, and at an angle they can be reasonably seen by the opponent.
* Combatants may strike any opponent who is part of a line if the attack is delivered within a 180 degree arc relative to the local line the opponent is a part of.
* Killing from behind is allowed if it has been announced beforehand.  Per society rules for "death from behind" in melees shall be:  Killing from behind is achieved by laying the weapon over the opponent's shoulder, so that the tip is visible to the opponent, while calling out clearly “You have been killed from behind” or other short clear phrase. The combatant must take care not to strike their opponent with the quillons, guard, or other part of the weapon.


# Event reporting
* Anyone can file a report using the form on the marshal's website for any marshal activity. You don't have to be the MiC, or even a marshal to bring things to the attention of the Kingdom marshallate.
* File reports within 7 days of the event.
* If there is an injury you must fill this out within 24 hours.
* Discipline MiCs should file the report and then inform the overall event MiC that it has been done; event MiCs should make sure all discipline reports are filed.
* Please be certain to report any of the following events:
    * Equipment failure (armor, weapon or other)
    * Report any failed mask/helm and why it failed.
    * Injury (any event that requires the fighter to leave the field)
    * Conflict issues (disrespect for, or arguments with, any fighter, marshal or support staff)
    * Rules confusion (misunderstanding of or disregard for any rule)
    * Please give us details on both good and bad things so we can detect patterns if things occur at multiple events.
    * It's a good habit to take pictures and you are able to attaches pictures to event reports
    * Names, names, names.  Names of your marshals, your MITs, your MoL(s), your authorization attempts, problem folks, good folks, etc.

# Support Staff
* MoLs are responsible for authorization paperwork and managing tournament rosters.
* MoLs, waterbearers, chirugeons, heralds, & marshals etc are all giving of their free time so we can play. Rudeness will not be tolerated & is against Kingdom and Society law 3.1.3.5.1.

# Paperwork
* Become familiar with the earl marshal website
* If you are running a practice, familiarize yourself with the waiver reporting requirements
* Be sure to go to earl marshal page and use "request a new warrant" to tell KRM you took this class
    * You are required to have an AEL account
    * Specify if you are starting your MIT process or completing your training requirements
* Print the rules, keep them with you at every event you marshal.
* Print a copy of your MIT form, a copy can be found in the paperwork section of the earl marshal website.
* To stay current, sign up for the Atlantian Marshal's mailing list, Unofficial Facebook group, and read the ACORN
