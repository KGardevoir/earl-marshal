## Introduction and Course Goals
The goal of the Armored steel combat Marshal 101 class is to provide
individuals with the basic background required to begin a successful journey
toward a marshal’s warrant. It is not an instruction in all rules of armored
steel combat. This outline, in fact, assumes that the instructor and students
are thoroughly familiar with the most recent edition of the Society Marshal’s
Handbook and Kingdom Law as it relates to armored steel combat.

When Armored Steel combat 101 discusses specific rules, it should focus on
those rules and standards that are relatively new, often confused or
misapplied. In addition, this course provides a background in managing
authorizations, interacting with combatants, and conducting inspections. It
does not overlap with Field 201, also required of all marshals.

### For Instructors: 
* Armored Steel Fighting Rules, Conventions, and Instructions will be referred to as 'The Rules'
* A copy of the rules must be available and referenced to properly complete this course of instruction. 

Prospective MITs are required to complete both Armored Steel combat 101 and Field 201 before taking the field as MITs.

Please send comments to the Deputy Earl Marshal for Training.

## Armor Standards and Inspections
### How to Inspect

* Remember, inspections are pass/fail first. Ensure that the fighter knows that he or she has passed or failed, and provide the reason for any failure. A fighter should be given the opportunity to remedy the failure and return to the marshal who failed the item for re-inspection.
* If an item appears to be close to failure, advise the combatant of the impending failure and potential consequences should failure occur during a bout. 
* If a helmet is close to failure, it will be reported to the combatant and will be noted on the marshal report. Helmet will require re-inspection if a fix was attempted or the fighter must have a new helmet at the next event
* Conduct the inspection in the same order every time—this will help you avoid making errors
	* Have you signed in with the MOL?
	* Are you wearing groin protection?
	* Armor first, head to knees, then weapons
	* See the rules for specifics of inspection and requirements for armor and weapons

### Overall appearance 10’ rule
* Intention is to improve the appearance of the field, not prevent people from playing
* Fighter’s kit shall look medieval at a distance of 10’ or greater
* In general, this means no obvious sports logos, fluorescent colors, etc.
* See the rules for specifics
* Be especially polite and helpful in enforcement of this rule, but firm. This also applies to authorizing fighters. This is something that should be first addressed at the local practice level.

### Weapon Standards and Inspections
* The only permitted weapons are steel constructed longswords (bastard swords -) and arming swords (broad swords).
* Commercial production swords are recommended and they must meet the minimums outlined in section III.B.2 in the rules .
* Swords may have basket hilts.  In conjunction with rigid constructed demi-gauntlets, they must meet all the requirements of a gauntlet. A basket hilted sword must still meet all the requirements for swords listed above. 
* Swords will have a safety strap to keep them from leaving the fighters person.
* The cross guard of all weapons shall not extend more than 35 MM from the gauntlet.
* See the rules Section III.B for specifics

### Offensive shields
* Prohibited under Atlantian policy

## Authorizations
### Selecting an usher
* Try to select a fighter with at least three years of experience
* They should be unflappable in personality and controlled in their fighting
* Confirm with the usher that they must be willing to be struck by the authorizing fighter, to deliberately leave openings
* Best but not currently required, use a fighter from outside of the authorizing fighter’s group.

### Selecting marshals
* Authorizing marshals should be experienced individuals who know armored steel combat well
* They must be willing to let the authorizing fighter stand on his or her own merits and be willing to fail an individual
* If reasonably possible, at least one marshal must be from a group outside of the authorizing fighter group. (barony, shire)

### Questions
* Authorizing fighter must have read the rules of the list and must demonstrate a command of them.
* Marshals should not answer questions for fighters, nor provide hints
* Authorizing fighter should be encouraged to demonstrate a point if he/she cannot express the requirements clearly verbally
* Authorizing fighter may not proceed to the fighting phases unless he or she has demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the rules of the list, particularly engagement and target zones.

### Phases
* Provide clear instructions to both the authorizing fighter and the usher:
	* The combat shall be non-stop (i.e., without stopping to call blows)
	* The authorizing fighter must demonstrate a level of safety, control and proficiency.
	* Demonstrates familiarity with the rules and follows the instructions of the Marshal’s.
	* “Can take a blow and can Give a blow”
	* Final bout shall be a timed 60 second bout run as in a tournament

### Paperwork
* It is the responsibility of the authorizing fighter to obtain all appropriate signatures on paperwork before the end of the event day

## Injuries on the field
Marshalls (generally speaking) are not physicians, but do have a responsibility to the safety of fighters under their management. Fighters should be allowed to monitor their own level of injury and gauge their ability to engage in combat activities. Some special cases, however, are mentioned below:

### Bloodborne pathogens
Fighters with freely flowing wounds must be removed from the field until the wounds can be dressed in such a way to prevent blood (or vomit) from coming into contact with other participants in the activities of the day.

Marshals should seek to identify the root cause of any cut or bloody injury to confirm that the armor and weapons of the participants continue to meet Society standards

### Concussion
Fighters who are rendered unconscious may not return to the field that day and should be encouraged to seek professional medical care.  Some signs and symptoms of a concussion are:
* Blank stare, dazed look
* Changes to balance, coordination, reaction time
* Delayed or slowed spoken or physical responses
* Disorientation (confused about time, date, location, game)
* Loss of consciousness/blackout (occurs in less than 10% of cases)
* Memory loss of event before, during, or after injury occurred
* Slurred/unclear speech
* Vomiting

## MIT Program
### Purpose
* Attempt to ensure a uniformity of training and experience among the marshallate such that rules are being enforced in the same way across the kingdom.
* Provide new marshals with the mental toolkit necessary to manage fights and uphold armor and weapons standards in potentially stressful situations.
* REMEMBER: MITs are NOT marshals and cannot, on their own, monitor fights, inspect armor or weapons, or sign off on paperwork.

### Role of mentor
* Provide guidance and practical instruction to the MIT
* Certify the competence of the MIT

## Marshalling a fight (Field Marshaling)
* As the fighters are entering the list, visually inspect them to confirm that there is no obviously missing or defective armor.
* Examine strap(s) that secure the visor if used stand in a location relative to the fight that provides the maximum ability to view the fight this means as the fight moves you may need to move as well.
* Watch fighters for disallowed techniques, armor failures and other safety issues
* Assign penalties as identified in the rules in section V.B 

### Spectator management
* Marshals must keep spectators and unarmored fighters outside of the safety zones around the outside of the list.

### Showmanship and field presence
* It is expected that marshals will adhere to the same period appearance rules as are required of fighters (preferably exceeding them)
* Marshals should conduct themselves in a calm and chivalrous manner at all times
* Marshal should identifiable to spectators and fighters as a marshal from a distance by wearing the badge of the office and having a marshal’s staff.

### Refer to section V of Armored Steel Fighting Rules, Conventions, and Instructions for specific responsibilities of event marshals
* Of Particular note: Blades should be inspected for sharp burrs each round. Have a file at  hand to remedy such issues
* Keep track of issues noted during the activities of the day and report them to the MIC
* Inspection failures, helmet failures and armor failures on the field that can not be corrected should be noted in your report
* MIC shall be given a summary of the event report from the event marshal at the end of the day/event
* Event report will be completed within 1 week of the event.
