## Rules

Armored Combat fighting in Atlantia is governed by an ordered hierarchy of rules.

* [Kingdom Earl Marshal's Policy (as of 2022-21-01)](/documents/Earl-Marshal-policy-2022-12-01.pdf) - This document incorporates the policies and rules for all marshal activities, not just Armored Combat.  (Rule updates from the previous revision in bold).
2. [SCA's Armored Marshal's Handbook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Armored_Combat_Handbook-Oct_2023.pdf).  These rules define the Society's armored combat rules.

At events, all equipment or clothing used by participants on the list field must either have a pre-17th Century appearance or be covered in a manner to present such an appearance.  For implementation, please see the [Guidance regarding Blatantly Modern Items on the List Field](/procedures/modern/).
