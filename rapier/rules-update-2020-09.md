## Rubber-tipped Spears

Atlantia now allows for the use of rubber-tipped spears in both rapier and C&T combat.  

### Spear Use

Light Rapier: Rapier Spears are specifically precluded from use in light rapier.  

In tournaments: Spears are considered "non-standard", which means an opponent may decline to face a non-standard device without forfeiting a bout.

In melee: The marshal-in-charge of an activity may limit Rapier Spears on a per-activity basis as long as the limitation is widely announced.  As an example, after bringing all participants together, announce: "For the next melee, you may not use Rapier Spears."

### Concerns in Spears

1. The only valid blow with a spear is a thrust.  Spears may *not* be used to deliver any type of cut.
2. Grasping equipment isn't specifically banned, but easily becomes grappling.  Our working definition of what constitutes banned grappling/brawling tactics is "meaningfully alter your opponent's balance".
3. Significantly less armor to protect against incidental contact.  Knees, elbows, fingers, and heads have significantly higher armor standards on the armored field, which mitigate incidental impacts.
4. Stiff parries & beats may cause incidental impacts, not just on the person direclty across from the combatant, but to neighboring combatants.

### Path Forwards

1. Slow and methodical roll-out.
2. For the foreseeable future, all Rapier Spear activities must be marshaled by a rapier marshal with a Rapier Spear authorization.
3. All those marshaling Rapier Spear activity must record and submit detailed feedback in the Event Report as to the efficacy, safety, and any issues raised during Rapier Spear activities.
4. Individuals will be limited to 1v1 combat *only* until demonstrable evidence of efficacy beyond initial authorization levels.

## Parry-Only Daggers

All equipment with a steel or rubber blade must pass the blade requirements.  Equipment without a blade is not an offensive weapon in the context of Rapier in Atlantia.  As an example, an armored combat rattan dagger does not have a blade, and therefore can be used as a parrying device, similar to the already approved wooden dowel rod or rolling pin.

## Knee-Walking

Knee-Walking is allowed by society policy at all times.  The marshal-in-charge of an activity may limit knee-walking on a per-activity basis as long as the limitation is widely announced.  As an example, after bringing all participants together, announce: "For the next melee, you may only knee walk to engagement."

## C&T Melee

The new society rules allow for melees using C&T combat.  All participants in C&T melee must hold an active C&T authorization and must be actively marshaled by someone approved to marshal C&T combat in Atlantia.  Participants with a Rapier Spear authorization approved to fight in melee with a rapier spear, without a C&T authorization, may participate in C&T melees using only a Rapier Spear, provided they are wearing appropriate C&T equipment.

All those marshaling C&T melee must record and submit detailed feedback in the Event Report as to the efficacy, safety, and any issues raised during C&T melee activities.

## C&T blows to the legs

In C&T, blows to the leg are no longer considered "fighting-ending".  Participants that receive a blow to the leg must follow standard rapier guidelines for blows to the leg.  As with rapier, participants that do not wish to continue after receiving a blow to the leg may choose to take any blow as a "killing" blow.

## Updated guidance for armor coverage

The [new society handbook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FencingMarshalsHandbookApril2020.pdf) includes images that explicitly defines the minimum armor coverage required for torso, neck, and head.  All participants must meet these standards.

### Head Coverage

### Torso Coverage

## Thrown Cloaks

Cloaks may be thrown towards an opponent, but may specifically not throw cloaks over an opponent's face or with the intent to trip an opponent. 

Equipment on the ground does not implicitly imply a safety hazard warranting a hold, nor does it implicitly mean the combatant can call hold to pick it up their fallen equipment.  Combatants and marshals should use encouraged to use good judgement in handling fallen equipment.  Purposeful use of rules intended to enhance safety, such as holds, to gain tactical advantage, is an unacceptable abuse of the rules.

## New "Front 180" rules

The [new society handbook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FencingMarshalsHandbookApril2020.pdf) includes specific language that defines where participants can strike their opponents:

This includes:
* 5.3.2. Combatants may strike any single opponent they can safely reach with any legal blow if they are within a 180 degree arc of the opponent’s front as defined by the opponent’s shoulders, and at an angle they can be reasonably seen by the opponent.
* 5.3.3. Combatants may strike any opponent who is part of a line if the attack is delivered within a 180 degree arc relative to the local line the opponent is a part of.
* 5.3.4. Outside of these above stated lines, killing (without striking) from behind may be allowed. The rules governing this are in the section Use of Weapons and Defensive Objects.
* 5.3.5. A combatant may not deliberately ignore an attacker behind them, or repeatedly maneuver to keep their back to an attacker (thereby preventing an attack on them).

## Projectile Weapons

The [new society handbook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FencingMarshalsHandbookApril2020.pdf) includes specific language that defines projectile weapons, including RGBs, Bows, and Crossbows.

Using Projectile Weapons within rapier combat is now governed by Combat Archery marshals, including Rubber Band Guns, Bows, Crossbows, and thrown weapons.  To use Projectile Weapons in Rapier Combat, the combat must be marshaled by a rapier marshal AND a combat archery marshal.
