# Rubber-tipped Spears

Atlantia now allows for the use of rubber-tipped spears in both rapier and C&T combat.  Rapier Spears are specifically precluded from use in light rapier.  For the forseeable future, all Rapier Spear activities must be actively marshalled by a rapier marshal with a Rapier Spear authorization.

All those marshalling Rapier Spear activity should record and submit detailed feedback in the Event Report as to the efficacy, safety, and any issues raised during Rapier Spear activities.

The marshal-in-charge of an activity may limit Rapier Spears on a per-activity basis as long as the limitation is widely announced.  As an example, after bringing all participants together, announce: "For the next melee, you may not use Rapier Spears."

# Parry-Only Daggers

All equipment with a steel or rubber blade must pass the blade requirements.  Equipment without a blade is not an offensive weapon in the context of Rapier in Atlantia.  As an example, an armored combat rattan dagger does not have a blade, and therefore can be used as a parrying device, similar to the already approved wooden dowel rod or rolling pin.

# Knee-Walking

Knee-Walking is allowed by society policy at all times.  The marshal-in-charge of an activity may limit knee-walking on a per-activity basis as long as the limitation is widely announced.  As an example, after bringing all participants together, announce: "For the next melee, you may only knee walk to engagement."

# C&T Melee

The new society rules allow for melees using C&T combat.  All participants in C&T melee must hold an active C&T authorization and must be actively marshaled by someone approved to marshal C&T combat in Atlantia.  Participants with a Rapier Spear authorization without a C&T authorization may participate in C&T melees only Rapier Spears.  

All those marshalling C&T melee should record and submit detailed feedback in the Event Report as to the efficacy, safety, and any issues raised during C&T melee activities.

# C&T blows to the legs

In C&T, blows to the leg are no longer considered "fighting-ending".  Participants that receive a blow to the leg must follow standard rapier guidelines for blows to the leg.  As with rapier, participants that do not wish to continue after receiving a blow to the leg may choose to take any blow as a "killing" blow.

# Updated guidance for armor coverage

The [new society handblook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FencingMarshalsHandbookApril2020.pdf) includes images that explicity define the minimum armor coverage required for torso armor, gorget, and mask coverage on pages 19, 20, and 21 respectively.  All participants must meet these standards.

# Thrown Cloaks

Cloaks may be thrown towards an opponent, but may specifically not throw cloaks over an opponent's face or with the intent to trip an opponent.  

# New "Front 180" rules

The [new society handblook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FencingMarshalsHandbookApril2020.pdf) includes specific language that defines where participants can strike their opponents:

This includes:
* 5.3.2. Combatants may strike any single opponent they can safely reach with any legal blow if they are within a 180 degree arc of the opponent’s front as defined by the opponent’s shoulders, and at an angle they can be reasonably seen by the opponent.
* 5.3.3. Combatants may strike any opponent who is part of a line if the attack is delivered within a 180 degree arc relative to the local line the opponent is a part of.
* 5.3.4. Outside of these above stated lines, killing (without striking) from behind may be allowed. The rules governing this are in the section Use of Weapons and Defensive Objects.
* 5.3.5. A combatant may not deliberately ignore an attacker behind them, or repeatedly maneuver to keep their back to an attacker (thereby preventing an attack on them).

# Projectile Weapons

The [new society handblook](https://www.sca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FencingMarshalsHandbookApril2020.pdf) includes specific language that defining projectile weapons, including RGBs, Bows, and Crossbows.

All projectile equipment must be inspected by a warranted Combat Archery marshal and combat actively marshalled by a Combat Archery marshal following Combat Archery policies and procedures.
