# Latest Society Rapier Marshal changes

The Society Rapier Marshal (SRM) published an approved update to the society rapier rules [0]. This update includes additional requirements for hand protection for those participating in Cut & Thrust. These rules will be not be enforced until the start of Pennsic 2018 (July 27th, 2018). As such, you have a short period of time to bring your kit into compliance with the new rules.

Specifically, the rules have the following additional requirements:

    For cut and thrust rapier, hands and wrists require additional protection from being struck by percussive blows:
    a. Areas of the backs of gloved hands, fingers and thumbs, to one inch above the wrist of both arms not protected by a hilt, parrying device, or rigid armor must, at a minimum, be protected by an additional layer of 1/4" open cell foam or equivalent resilient padding.
    b. If any combatant is using a two-handed weapon, all combatants in the bout must have rigid protection for areas listed in 2.D.v.a.

The wording could use work, but evidence collected from a society level shows a trend that needed addressed.  In the last three years, 811 C&T combatants received 18 reported hand injuries.  In contrast, 4159 heavy rapier combatants received 5 reported hand injuries in the same time period.  Additionally, our kingdom accounts for 3 out of the 18 injuries reported in the last 3 years, and so our kingdom is not excluded from the trend that needs corrected.

When evaluating protection needed, please understand the additional protection is intended to address percussive blows, not thrusts.

A few important comments:
* The additional armor requirements is *not* justification for increased calibration.  Fighters are expected to continue to use good judgement and care for their opponent regardless of the armor choices of their opponent.
* Your armor must still meet period appearance rules.  The examples provided by the SRM include hockey gloves.  Most modern hockey gloves do not meet the period appearance rules without modification or covering.
* None of the examples of equipment that meets these requirements is necessarily an endorsement of the product.
* During a tournement, combatants are expected to come to agreement for needed armor requirements, or both fighters will take a loss for the tourney.

# How to inspect

Marshals inspecting C&T armor to follow these new rules will need to do the following:

* For any fight where either combatant is using a two-handed weapon, both fighters must have rigid components that cover the back of their fingers, hand, until one inch past the points of the wrists to provide protection from typical percussive cuts.  These components can be made up of the hilt, armor, and shields.
* For any fight where both combatants are *not* using a two-handed weapon, both fighters must have at least padding equivalent to 1/4" open cell foam for the fingers, hand, and until one inch past the points of the wrist for any area not protected by hilt, armor, or shields.  Fighters may choose to use rigid components rather than padding.

In the future, this page will include pictures of weapons and armor that meet these requirements.

# How will this impact you?

* Fighting with swept hilt rapier: If you are facing a longsword, you need a rigid demi-gauntlet, such as those available from Windrose Armory [2].  If you are facing anything else, then use a padded glove such as the gloves from Revival Clothing [3]
* Fighting with a ring dagger: If you are facing a longsword, you need an equivalent glove to the longsword fighter such as a hockey glove.  If you are facing anything else, then use a padded glove as described above.
* Fighting with a blocking dagger (such as the reaver dagger from Darkwood): If you are facing a longsword, you need a rigid demi-gauntlet.  If you are facing anything else, use a padded glove.
* Using a longsword:  You need at least a hockey glove.  Other known good examples are Koning gloves, SPES heavy gauntlets, or Egg Armory gauntlets.
