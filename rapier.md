## Rules

Rapier fighting in Atlantia is governed by an ordered hierarchy of rules.

1. Kingdom Rapier Rules, defined in [Section 3.11](https://atlantia.sca.org/134-offices/seneschal/policies-and-laws/atlantian-book-of-policy/marshal-pages/116-3-11-section-xi-rapier-combat) of the Atlantian [Book of Policy](https://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law/policy/seneschal).  These rules define Atlantia's specific rapier conventions and take precidence over all other rules.
2. Kingdom Marshal Rules, defined in [Section 3](https://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law/policy/marshal) of the Atlantian [Book of Policy](https://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law/policy/seneschal), excluding the components specific to other forms of combat.  These rules define Atlantia's overall marshal conventions.
3. Society Rapier Rules, defined in the [SCA's Rapier Marshal's Handbook](http://www.sca.org/officers/marshal/docs/rapier/rapier_handbook.pdf).  These rules define the SCA's rapier conventions.
4. Society Marshal's rules, defined in the [SCA's Marshal's Handbook](http://www.sca.org/officers/marshal/docs/marshal_handbook.pdf), excluding the components specific to other forms of combat.  These rules define the Society's overall marshal conventions.

In some melee combat scenarios, combat archery may be employed.  Combat Archery rules are defined in [Section 3.5.3](https://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law/policy/marshal?faqitem=KingdomMarshal4) of the Atlantian [Book of Policy](https://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law/policy/seneschal).

At events, all equipment or clothing used by participants on the list field must either have a pre-17th Century appearance or be covered in a manner to present such an appearance per [Section 10.3](https://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law/book-of-law/reservations-and-restrictions?faqitem=Policy2) of the Atlantian [Book of Law](https://atlantia.sca.org/offices/seneschal/clerk-of-law/book-of-law/laws-of-the-kingdom).  For implementation, please see the [Guidance regarding Blatantly Modern Items on the List Field](/procedures/modern/).

## Policy interpretations and addendums
1. All rapier-MICs must submit an event report even if they are not the MIC.
2. Anyone that marshals rapier combat at all during an event must meet with the rapier-MIC to discuss the activities they observed and convey any concerns or issues.
3. Individuals may not fight and marshal in the same activity (melee or tournament).  If multiple activities occur in a single day, individuals may fight in one and marshal another provided they are not the marshal in charge. 
4. Warranted rapier marshals may only perform inspections and authorizations for all rapier forms they hold a valid authorization.
